                                    damage to persons, animals, or other goods, or that are susceptible to damage or
                                    corrosion unless there is a prior written agreement. If such goods are delivered to
                                    the shipping agent without any prior agreement, the shipping agent is entitled, if
                                    required under the circumstances, to proceed with their sale or even in case of
                                    imminent danger, to proceed with their destruction. The client is responsible for
                                    any damage that occurs and bears all related expenses.</p>

                                    under special conditions, e.g., explosives, flammable or corrosive materials,
                                    radioactive materials, or materials emitting fumes, the order must be considered
                                    null and void. But if the transport is performed, the shipping agent will not bear
                                    responsibility for all damages and expenses that may occur. On the other hand, it is
                                    entitled to take any necessary measures to protect the rest of the goods during
                                    transport, persons, and the environment, and the client bears the expenses.</p>
